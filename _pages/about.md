# How can we design and build robust community functions?

## Microbes inhabit agricultural soils, crops, and human mucosal systems, shaping the flux of functionally important metabolites. Therefore, controlling their metabolic activities (functions) is crucial for the planet’s greenhouse gas emissions and human health. A major hurdle in applying microbial solutions at scale is the lack of functional consistency and robustness in real-world environments. This is because most microbial solution designs do not systematically account for the abiotic and biotic environments the microbes experience when deployed in nature (Lee et al., 2023). My research program addresses this lack of functional robustness, one of microbiome science’s greatest obstacles, by integrating high-throughput metabolite measurements, modeling, machine learning, and synthetic biology. 

## I am currently a postdoctoral scholar at the University of Delaware, [Chemical & Biomolecular Engineering](https://cbe.udel.edu/), advised by Dr. [Aditya Kunjapur](https://www.kunjapurlab.org/) and Dr. [Jacques Ravel](https://www.medschool.umaryland.edu/profiles/ravel-jacques/) at the University of Maryland School of Medicine in Baltimore, Maryland.
